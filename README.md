# Diamond Sweeper

## Goal

The rules of the game are as follows:

* The game board has 8x8 squares (initially, all represented by question marks)
* There are 8 diamonds hidden on the board, each diamond behind one of the squares
* When the user clicks on a square
    * If the square was hiding a diamond, the diamond appears
    * Otherwise, the square is opened, and blank
* The game ends when all diamonds are found. The user's score is the number of squares still left unturned.
